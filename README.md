Insites UI is an opinionated UI components library, powered by TypeScript, 
Styled Components and Styled System. It comes with source version in TypeScript,
yet we have a dist version in JavaScript for you.

## Motivation

Our products utilize similar UI patterns, so we decided to create our
own UI library, to speed up our delivery. If these patterns match your
needs, feel free to use it.

## Installation

Please refer to our [Getting started](https://insites-ui-docs.netlify.com/getting-started/) guide.

## Development

If you'd like to help us and contribute, then here's how to run the development version:

1. Clone the repo.

2. Open the directory and run `yarn storybook` inside.

3. Development's version of Storybook will open in your browser.
